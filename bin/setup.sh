# detecting the need for refresh of templates/* derived files.  To bump the root version, 
# zap all templates/* containing 'ShellkitTemplateVers' constants and changes to the corresponding dependent kits
# Note that within templates/* there may be diverse versions in upstream shellkit, they don't all have to match,
# but the derived copies should be sync'ed with upstream as needed.
